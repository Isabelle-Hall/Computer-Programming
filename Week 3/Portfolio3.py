#1. Modify your greeting program so that if the user does not enter a name (i.e. they just press enter), the program responds "Hello, Stranger!".
# Otherwise it should print a greeting with their name as before.

#2. Write a program that simulates the way in which a user might choose a password.
# The program should prompt for a new password, and then prompt again.
# If the two passwords entered are the same the program should say "Password Set" or similar, otherwise it should report an error.

#3. Modify your previous program so that the password must be between 8 and 12 characters (inclusive) long.

#4. Modify your program again so that the chosen password cannot be one of a list of common passwords, defined thus:
# BAD_PASSWORDS = ['password', 'letmein', 'sesame', 'hello', 'justinbieber']

#5. Modify your program a final time so that it executes until the user successfully chooses a password.
# That is, if the password chosen fails any of the checks, the program should return to asking for the password the first time.

#6. Write a program that displays the "Seven Times Table".
# That is, the result of multiplying 7 by every number from 0 to 12 inclusive. The output might start:
# 0 x 7 = 0
# 1 x 7 = 7
# 2 x 7 = 14
# and so on.

#7. Modify your "Times Table" program so that the user enters the number of the table they require.
# This number should be between 0 and 12 inclusive.

#8. Modify the "Times Table" again so that the user still enters the number of the table, but if this number is negative the table is printed backwards.
# So entering "-7" would produce the Seven Times Table starting at "12 times" down to "0 times"
