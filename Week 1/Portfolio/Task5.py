#5 The Head of Computing at the University of Poppleton is tasked with dividing a group of students into lab groups. 
# A lab group is 24 students, since this is the number of PCs in a lab. 
# Write a program that calculates how many groups are needed for the following number of students: 113, 175, 12. 
# Display how many full groups there will be, and how many students will be in the smaller "left over" group.
lab_group = 24
group1 = 113 // 24
group2 = 175 // 24
group3 = 12 / 24
print("For 113 students you will need ", group1, "groups")
print("For 175 students you will need ", group2, "groups")
print("For 12 students you will need ", group3, "groups")
